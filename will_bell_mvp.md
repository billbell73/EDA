##Crazy Donuts' pre-negotiation NYC subway station footfall analysis

The goal of this project is to equip Crazy Donuts with MTA data on how footfall outside their concession premises in NYC subway stations has changed as a result of the Coronavirus Pandemic.

The figure depicts the percentage change in daily turnstile entries between January 2019 and January 2021 for subway stations which house Crazy Donuts concessions.

It shows a significant reduction in passenger traffic at all stations. It also shows the amount of reduction differs according to station, with the least affected relevant station, Fordham Road, seeing roughly half the reduction of the most affected, Brooklyn Bridge. 

It will be interesting to see how these results are affected by including data from other months apart from January, narrowing the time-window down to 'Donut Time' (i.e. the morning commute), and including exits as well as entries.
